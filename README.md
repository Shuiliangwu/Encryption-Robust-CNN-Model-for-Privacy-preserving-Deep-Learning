This project is basically mapping the real-world case of privacy-preserving deep learning. In this project, we performed both roles as a service provider and an eavesdropper. We proposed an Encryption-Robust (ER) model for privacy-preserving deep learning. The ER model is based on a regular CNN classification model and an adaptation network. The adaptation network was developed using convolution to perform the decryption. In total eight pre-trained models applied in this project, ConvNeXt-Base outperformed others and achieved highest accuracy values for both dataset 1 (84.25% as the highest for dataset 1) and dataset 2 (94.28%) provided. Adaptation network and multi-round training strategy were then applied with ConvNeXt-Base to do the decryption. It achieved an improvement on decryption on dataset1 and performed outstandingly on dataset 2. Moreover, the accuracy value was further increased to 96.72% (as the highest for dataset 2) with the application of adaptation network and multi-round training strategy.


A flaw was realized that pretrained ConvNeXt-Base has already seen and memorized all of the original images from dataset 2 thus the results on dataset 2 were possibly not solid. To ensure no-overlapping on images for pretraining and decryption, two different approaches were developed. The first approach using self-pretrained ResNet50 model showed that adaptation network after multi-round training can have an effective decryption capacity. The second approach using images from imageNet21k doesnâ€™t show good decryption. One possible reason is that the dataset used in approach two is more complicated with multiple types of objects contained in a single class. Time limitation is another reason.
